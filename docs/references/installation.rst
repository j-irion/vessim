Installation
============

If you are using Vessim for the first time, we recommend to clone and install this repository, so you have all
code and examples at hand:

.. code-block:: console 
    
    pip install -e .

Alternatively, you can also install our `latest release <https://pypi.org/project/vessim/>`_
via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install vessim
