What can I do with it?
======================

Vessim allows users to test real applications within a co-simulation testbed composed of domain-specific simulators on energy system components.
The following Figure shows the different aspects of carbon-aware systems that can be investigated through Vessim.

As depicted in the above Figure, Vessim enables research on various aspects related to the interplay of energy and computing systems.

    - **Energy system composition**: Examine how integrating components like solar panels affects computing systems. Evaluate requirements for energy-autonomous data centers and potential impacts of future technologies.
    - **Energy system abstractions**: Vessim simplifies microgrid complexities through simulation, focusing on safety and carbon-aware applications while virtualizing energy systems.
    - **Energy system interfaces**: Investigate integration of new components, handling external data, and ensuring secure, controlled access across geo-distributed systems.
    - **Carbon-aware applications**: Vessim allows rapid prototyping of carbon-aware computing ideas, offering access to current standards and promoting common dataset use.

Besides facilitating research, Vessim can support the development and quality assurance of carbon-aware applications and systems. 
For example, it can be applied in continuous integration testing, or used to validate software roll-outs in a controlled environment.
Additionally, using Vessim as a digital twin, carbon-aware datacenters can predict future system states, aid decision-making, and assess risks during extreme events like power outages.
