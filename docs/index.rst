Overview
==========

Vessim is a versatile **co-simulation testbed for carbon-aware applications and systems**. 
It lets users connect domain-specific simulators for energy system components such as renewable power generation, energy storage, and power flow analysis with real software and hardware.
It is based on `mosaik <https://mosaik.offis.de/>`_,  a general-purpose co-simulation framework.
Mosaik connects simulators of any language and real systems via TCP and ensures their synchronization. It also offers an API for defining simulation scenarios. 

Vessim is in alpha stage and under active development. Functionality and documentation will improve in the next weeks and months.

The documentation provides a guide explaining the concept of this project, two examples to get you started with it and an API reference.
